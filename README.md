Lecture notes on Kalman Filtering and it's Applications


# Acknowledgments
- The lecture slides are mainly based on the book, "Kalman Filter from the Ground Up" by Alex Becker. 
- The majority of the figures in the accompanying lecture slides are derived from the book, except for those created through my own code implementations.
- The codes provided here, along with the results they generate, are my original work.
- Additional content in the slides is sourced from various references, which are appropriately cited within the slides.
